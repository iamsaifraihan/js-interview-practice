# Can you write a function in JavaScript to remove duplicate elements from an array?

Write a function in JavaScript that takes an array as input and returns a new array with all duplicate elements removed. The order of the elements in the resulting array should be the same as their first occurrence in the input array.

** Requirements **

- The function should accept a single argument, which is an array of elements.
  The function should return a new array with duplicates removed.
- The order of elements in the output array should match their first occurrence in the input array.
- The function should handle arrays containing any data type (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).

## Examples:

Input
const inputArray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];

Output
const outputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
