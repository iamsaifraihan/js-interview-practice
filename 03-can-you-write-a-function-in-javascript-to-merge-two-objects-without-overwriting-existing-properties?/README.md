# Can you write a function in JavaScript to merge two objects without overwriting existing properties?

Write a function in JavaScript that takes two objects as input and merges them into a single object. The function should ensure that existing properties in the first object are not overwritten by properties from the second object. If a property exists in both objects, the value from the first object should be retained.
